                            I've heard many religious people say that you cannot have morals without them being based in religion. <br>
                            I think that is a tad biased and I will now explain what my secular morals are based on. <br>
                            <br>
                            Qualia are instances of subjective conscious experiences, that are difficult or impossible to explain to someone <br>
                            who does not share those experiences. An example of this is the perception of the colour green. You cannot explain <br>
                            green to a blind person, as they would have no frame of reference. <br>
                            <br>
                            Some of the most important examples of qualia are painful sensations. You could not explain how pain truly feels to <br>
                            an alien that has never felt pain, but you know from feeling it yourself that it is a very bad feeling that should <br>
                            be avoided. There are many things that we do and do not understand, but the one thing that we can know to be true <br>
                            is that we feel qualia, and we feel pain. <br>
                            <br>
                            Following this, the most concrete basis of morality is then that pain is bad and inflicting pain on others is bad. <br>
                            This isn't exactly a shocking revelation, but for some people this ethical basis needs to be spelt out. From this <br> 
                            basis, I then look at certain actions and judge whether or not they are immoral. <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I believe that people with different opinions can co-exist. Not everybody has to agree on everything, and in most <br>
                            cases what is and isn't moral can only be decided by those in a given situation. There are no blanket statements or <br>
                            unbreakable rules in morality, an action that may seem immoral on its own could prove moral in some circumstances. <br>
                            <br>
                            However, this co-existance does not include thoughts and opinions that are fueled by ignorance or hate, and cause <br>
                            real significant harm to others. Bigotry is unnacceptable at any level, as it both indirectly and directly causes <br>
                            pain to many people. <br>

                <div>

                        <p class="align-left paragraph">
                            As my ethical basis suggests, my morals are based in secular ideas, and thus I am not a religious person. <br>
                            Continuing the line of thinking from this ethical basis, I believe that people of different religions can co-exist, <br>
                            and I respect the right of religious freedom. Everybody should be able to decide for themselves which religions <br>
                            are and are not accurate to them, and then follow the religion they think is true. <br>
                            <br>
                            However, this respect of religious freedom does not mean that I respect all religions. I know many religious <br>
                            people that are very moral and likeable, but I also know that a lot of people use their religions as reasons to <br>
                            spread hate, or are part of religions that actively advocate for hate. All groups have extremists, especially <br>
                            religious groups, and some religions are worse than others. While I cannot agree with a religious person that <br>
                            does not spread hate, I can at least respect them and co-exist with them. <br>
                            <br>
                            As for why I'm not a member of any religions myself, it's simply because I don't think that there are any religions <br>
                            that are correct. Most of the religions I've been exposed to are based on old ideas, often with outdated science, <br>
                            immoral ideals, and a purely human-centered perspective. <br>
                            <br>
                            As our knowledge of the universe increases, there is less and less need for a god to exist, and there are more and <br>
                            more reasons for humans to not be the center of the universe. With the right evidence I could be swayed to believe <br>
                            in a new religion, but until then I have a secular mindset. <br>

                            Unsurprisingly, I am a left-leaning person. I'm unsure of what this means in the context of politics in specific <br>
