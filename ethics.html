                            I've heard many religious people say that you cannot have morals without them being based in religion. <br>
                            I think that is a tad biased and I will now explain what my secular morals are based on. <br>
                            <br>
                            Qualia are instances of subjective conscious experiences, that are difficult or impossible to explain to someone <br>
                            who does not share those experiences. An example of this is the perception of the colour green. You cannot explain <br>
                            green to a blind person, as they would have no frame of reference. <br>
                            <br>
                            Some of the most important examples of qualia are painful sensations. You could not explain how pain truly feels to <br>
                            an alien that has never felt pain, but you know from feeling it yourself that it is a very bad feeling that should <br>
                            be avoided. There are many things that we do and do not understand, but the one thing that we can know to be true <br>
                            is that we feel qualia, and we feel pain. <br>
                            <br>
                            Following this, the most concrete basis of morality is then that pain is bad and inflicting pain on others is bad. <br>
                            This isn't exactly a shocking revelation, but for some people this ethical basis needs to be spelt out. From this <br> 
                            basis, I then look at certain actions and judge whether or not they are immoral. <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Every culture has societal norms, many of which impose ethical ideas and biases onto the people that follow them. <br>
                            Some of these norms promote ideas supported by my ethical basis, such as killing and stealing being criminal and <br>
                            punishable offences, and being rude to strangers being frowned upon. Other norms however promote ideas that are more <br>
                            dangerous, such as the widespread mentality that weird things are immoral. <br>
                            <br>
                            Things that may seem uncommon, uninteresting, or just make you cringe, are not necessarily causing harm to yourself or <br>
                            others. Actions are only immoral if being so is supported by the ethical basis. Having a weird feeling about something <br>
                            you haven't thought about before, aren't interested in, or have a bias against, is not a reason for that thing to be <br>
                            'wrong'. That mentality is what leads to bigotry and other such mindsets that are actually immoral. <br>
                            <br>
                            If somebody is taking part in an action that is not immoral but seems weird, the true immoral thing in that situation is <br>
                            to put them down for said action, or to intentionally make them look foolish for doing something not considered 'normal'. <br>
                            There is no objective use for 'normal', as what is normal to you is only normal because of the society and culture you <br>
                            were brought up in. People who have different upbringings, interests, or feelings are not abnormal for being the way that <br>
                            they are, as that is what is normal to them. To say that the things that fall out of your small sphere of normality are <br>
                            abnormal, weird, or immoral, is biased and unethical. <br>

                            I believe that people with different opinions can co-exist. Not everybody has to agree on everything, and in most <br>
                            cases what is and isn't moral can only be decided by those in a given situation. There are no blanket statements or <br>
                            unbreakable rules in morality, an action that may seem immoral on its own could prove moral in some circumstances. <br>
                            <br>
                            However, this co-existance does not include thoughts and opinions that are fueled by ignorance or hate, and cause <br>
                            real significant harm to others. Bigotry is unnacceptable at any level, as it both indirectly and directly causes <br>
                            pain to many people. <br>
                            <br>
                            To say that a bigoted view is 'just an opinion' is to ignore how it affects people. An opinion isn't something that <br>
                            can be dismissed for not mattering. At the least, opinions are what cause the everyday lives of people in marginalized <br>
                            groups to be more difficult than others, and at the most, are what cause discriminatory laws to be made. Your views are <br>
                            what control your actions, and are what you spread to those around you. <br>
                            <br>
                            Similarly, when it comes to topics such as bigotry versus human rights, neutrality is also unnacceptable. You may <br>
                            think that staying neutral keeps you out of the discussion, and free from criticsm from either side, but in practice <br>
                            not picking a side can do just as much damage as choosing bigotry. In these situations, there are not 'good points from <br>
                            both sides'. You can either be for or against human rights for a marginalized group, there is no compromise in having <br>
                            <i>just a little bit of oppression</i>. Bigotry does not deserve respect at any level. <br>

                            As my ethical basis suggests, my morals are based in secular ideas, and thus I am not a religious person. <br>
                            I believe that people of different religions can co-exist, and I respect the right of religious freedom. <br>
                            Everybody should be able to decide for themselves which religions are and are not accurate to them, and then <br>
                            follow the religion they think is true. <br>
                            <br>
                            However, this respect of religious freedom does not mean that I respect all religions. I know many religious <br>
                            people that are very moral and likeable, but I also know that a lot of people use their religions as reasons to <br>
                            spread hate, or are part of religions that actively advocate for hate. All groups have extremists, especially <br>
                            religious groups, and some religions are worse than others. While I cannot agree with a religious person that <br>
                            does not spread hate, I can at least respect them and co-exist with them. <br>
                            <br>
                            As for why I'm not a member of any religions myself, it's simply because I don't think that there are any religions <br>
                            that are correct. Most of the religions I've been exposed to are based on old ideas, often with outdated science, <br>
                            immoral ideals, and a purely human-centered perspective. <br>
                            <br>
                            As our knowledge of the universe increases, there is less and less need for a god to exist, and there are more and <br>
                            more reasons for humans to not be the center of the universe. With the right evidence I could be swayed to believe <br>
                            in a new religion, but until then I have a secular mindset. <br>

                            Humans are animals. The only thing that separates humans from other animals is the advanced intellect. Many people <br>
                            feel as though humans are worth more than animals because of this intellect, but that mentality can get dicey fast. <br>
                            For example, some people have conditions where their mental capacity is much less than that of the average person. <br>
                            I personally don't think that people with lower mental capacities are worth less than those with average or higher <br>
                            mental capacities, that would be ableist at best. I also wouldn't say that an alien species with a higher intellect <br>
                            than humans would be worth more than us, and I would think most people would agree. <br>
                            <br>
                            It is a fact that animals other than humans can feel emotions and have their own life experiences. A dog can feel <br>
                            happy when their owner comes home, a bird can feel threatened by humans walking under their nests, etc. Some people <br>
                            try to deny this by saying the human experience is worth more, whether that is because of religious reasons, souls, <br>
                            or the intelligence once again, but none of these reasons stand because they exist only to further the idea that <br>
                            humans are worth more. They are inherantly biased thought processes. <br>
                            <br>
                            Since animals are not worth less than humans, and they experience life like humans do, then actions that cause them <br>
                            pain are immoral according to my ethical basis. To harm an animal physically or mentally is to be unethical. Because <br>
                            of this, I believe that eating meat and other such usage of animal products is immoral. <br>
                            <br>
                            The systems that society has developed in order to factory farm animals for their body parts is truly horrifying, so <br>
                            much so that I don't even want to get into it here. If it were humans in these conditions the world would riot, but <br>
                            because it is 'only' animals, people turn a blind eye so they can continue eating the food they like the taste of. <br>
                            I decided to stop eating meat a few years ago, but many people choose to instead lash out at those who value the <br>
                            lives of animals. As mentioned in the weirdness and norms section, many people are attached to harmful societal norms, <br>
                            and unfortunately meat eating is one of them. <br>

                            As an animal lover I enjoy having pets, and my personal favourite animals to have as pets are cats. Some people say that<br>
                            it is unethical to own pets, but I believe that not only is it ethical, but also a virtuous and honorable act. There <br>
                            are many animals that go unloved and risk being put down in animal shelters, and so adopting them as your pets is saving <br>
                            their lives. <br>
                            <br>
                            However, some people choose to buy pets from breeders instead of adopting animals that need a home. Doing this is very <br>
                            unethical, as it supports an industry that causes animal overpopulation and therefore euthanization, and often involves <br>
                            the abuse of the animals used for breeding. Nobody should buy pets from breeders for any reason. The most common reason <br>
                            that people buy pets this way is so they can get a certain breed of animal, but prioritizing owning a breed over saving <br>
                            a life is a very immoral thing to do, and oftentimes you can even both rescue an animal and get the breed you want anyway. <br>
                            <br>
                            I am also a firm believer that pets like cats should be strictly kept as indoor-only pets. The life expectency of an <br>
                            indoor cat is far greater than an outdoor cat, as they are immune to risks such as being hit by a car, getting illnesses <br>
                            from other cats, and cat fights. Keeping cats indoors also protects the local wildlife and avoids the cats getting taken <br>
                            by strangers who want a free cat. <br>
                            <br>
                            The main argument I see for letting cats go outside is that 'it is in their nature' and 'they need to be able to roam', <br>
                            but cats spend 20~ hours of the day sleeping, and whenever they walk into a room they have been in a million times they <br> 
                            act like they have never seen it before. Unless you live in a tiny apartment, there is enough room inside your home for <br>
                            your cat to stay indoors, and if you do live in conditions unsuitable for a pet, then you simply shouldn't have a pet. <br>

                            Unsurprisingly, I am a left-leaning person. I'm unsure of what this means in the context of politics in specific <br>
