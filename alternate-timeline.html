                <p class="align-left paragraph">
                    Minecraft is fundamentally flawed in many ways. <br>
                    The progression and combat are limited, exploration gets boring fast, and there's 10 years of content bloat. <br>
                    Not to mention how fast SMP's die out. <br>
                    <br>
                    Often when a game is in the mainstream for as long as Minecraft, a new version or update of the game is released to fix problems and remove unnecessary features. <br>
                    This can't happen for Minecraft though, as people don't want to lose their worlds, and whenever an old feature is changed the community reacts quite loudly. <br>
                    (eg: the combat update, zombified piglins, ore retextures, etc.) <br>
                    <br>
                    So this modpack explores an alternate timeline where Minecraft was developed slightly differently, and aims to create what Mojang can't, a version of Minecraft that is fundamentally fixed. <br>
                    But this is more than just a return to alpha, or adding a bunch of 'vanilla enhancing' mods like certain modpacks that claim to be 'better'. <br>
                    It's a foundational rework of the game, where almost every mechanic has been altered. <br>
                    <br>
                    ...Which is why it's still in development after all this time. You can read about it here though! Hopefully I made this wall of text enticing enough. <br>
                    And in the meantime, perhaps check out
