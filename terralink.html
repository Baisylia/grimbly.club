                    Terralink is an analogue horror adventure game set in the same universe as
                    <a onclick="navigate('verditen.html')" target="_blank">
                        Verditen,
                    </a>
                    acting as a prequel of sorts. <br>
                    It is a 3D first-person game with a pixelated rendering art style, where you collect mods for the company Terralink in order to earn a spot on their waiting list to get a robot body of your own.
                    You can travel to various planets and locations to battle criminals and outcasts, while mixing and matching different mods to unlock different abilities and attacks. <br>
                    <br>
                    The game is currently in the development stage, with the multiplayer framework being developed and the concept art / story being designed. <br>
                    The game's lore has just about been finalised, but I won't leak too much information about it here, you'll have to play the game when it's released!
