                <p class="align-left paragraph">
                    Grimbly Schmeggle is a tower defense game inspired by Bloons about killing invading grimblies, made by me and the other Eye Pea Games members for an assignment. <br>
                    It was a re-imagining of another game concept of mine, Ice Creamed, which was a tower defense game about desserts destroying breakfasts. <br>
                    Due to the time constraints of the assignment, Grimbly Schmeggle didn't come out as polished as I would have liked, so I started development on Grimbly Schmeggle 2. <br>
                    <br>
                    The main idea of Grimbly Schmeggle 2 is that the enemies evolve as you choose certain strategies, meaning that no two games will be the same. <br>
                    The game will have 5 tower classes, each containing 8 towers that can each be upgraded through 4 different skill paths. <br>
                    Grimbly Schmeggle 2 has been on hold for a while due to its large scope, so once development continues the large amount of towers will likely be released in updates.
