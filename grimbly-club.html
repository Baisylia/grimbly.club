                    I believe that everyone should have their own website, they are a great way to make portfolio of your work, and are a way to express yourself without the confines of social media. <br>
                    That is why I made grimbly.club. <br>
                    <br>
                    I also believe that the modern internet is cold, unfeeling, boring, uninspiring, predatory, and based around monetization. <br>
                    That is why I chose the old web aesthetic for grimbly.club. <br>
                    <br>
                    The idea of grimblies originated in a card game idea I had around 2021 or 2022. I wasn't satisfied with their usage in 
                    <a onclick="navigate('grimbly-schmeggle.html')" target="_blank">
                        Grimbly Schmeggle,
                    </a>
                    I felt as though they had more potential. <br>
                    That is why I made grimblies the mascots for grimbly.club.
