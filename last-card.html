                <p class="align-left paragraph">
                    Last Card is a playing card game that I designed and printed. <br>
                    It's a shedding card game similar to Uno where the aim is to remove all the cards from your hand. <br>
                    I designed the cards in Illustrator and play-tested the game in Tabletop Simulator, and then got them printed to play in real life. <br>
                    <br>

                    <br> <br>
                    Rules: <br>
                    The game has 3 piles of cards to keep track of, the deck pile, the discard pile, and the storage pile. <br>
                    Every round you attempt to discard a card into the discard pile, or draw a card from the deck if you cannot play one. <br>
                    The storage pile will grow and shrink as other cards cause interactions with it. <br>
                    You start the game with 7 cards in your hand, an another card is added to the discord before the game starts. <br>
                    <br>
                    Colours: <br>
                    There are 10 colours of cards, with 4 basic-coloured cards, 4 between-coloured cards, and 2 wild-coloured cards. <br>
                    Cards can be played on cards of the same colour or symbol. <br>
                    The between-coloured cards can be placed on card colours that they are made of, eg: purple cards can be placed on blue and red cards. <br>
                    Black wild cards allow the user to choose which colour the card will act as, out of the 4 possible colours shown on the card. <br>
                    Grey wild cards allow the next player to choose what the colour will be. <br>
                    <br>
                    Symbols: <br>
                    Draw cards force the next player to draw as many cards as the number listed on the card. <br>
                    Removal cards force the player to discard as many cards as the number listed on the card to the storage pile. <br>
                    There are numbered cards from 0 - 9 that have no special effects, and minus cards that act as any number. <br>
                    Plus cards force the next player to draw cards until they draw something they can play. <br>
                    Hash cards make the next player draw a maximum of 8 cards from the storage pile, but less than that if the pile doesn't have that many. <br>
                    Reverse cards flip the game order to be either clockwise or anticlockwise depending on the current order. <br>
                    Skip cards skip the next player's turn, and replay cards skip everyone's turn giving you another turn. <br>
                    Swap cards allow you to force another player to swap hands with you, and vortex cards for every player to swap hands in the current turn order. <br>
