                            I spend a lot of my time on my computer and as such I have many technology related preferences. <br>
                            I also think that wars between mainstream options such as Apple vs Android are stupid. <br>
                            Any option can be the best option in certain scenarios, and I have no loyalty to any brand. <br>
                            The following are my current tech preferences, based on many factors and variables that I don't care to get into. <br>

                        <p class="align-left paragraph">
                            According to Jeb's Minecraft design book, Minecraft is a multiverse. Every world has its own lore that is decided by the player. <br>
                            This is great, Minecraft is a game driven by the player's imagination after all, but it is clear that Mojang has its own lore in <br>
                            mind as well, that's how the creative process works. I like to think of their intended lore as the prime timeline, the true Minecraft <br>
                            world in the Minecraft multiverse. This prime world consists of all the lore set in the base game, as well as Minecraft Dungeons (MCD) <br>
                            and even Minecraft Legends (MCL).<br>
                            <br>
                            There is a case to be made that MCL is just a story told by villagers, but just like how MCD was the reason illagers were added to <br>
                            the base game, Mojang had MCL in mind when adding piglins to the base game. Whether or not all of MCL is completely factual, it is <br>
                            clear that it is at least based on their intentions for the prime timeline. This idea is assisted by the fact that the trailer for A <br>
                            Minecraft Movie (MCM) has an important Minecraft Legends character in it, the ideas established in MCL are persistent in other MC media. <br>
                            It could then also be argued that MCM is also canon to the prime timeline, but it is impossible to say for certain until it is released.<br>
                            <br>
                            The lore of the prime timeline is actually more set in stone than you may think at first, as the spinoff games are full of confirmed <br>
                            pieces of lore information, and Minecraft itself is full of small lore details. The following is lore that is inarguably confirmed, <br>
                            strongly assumed, and educatedly theorised. <br>
                            <br>

                            - Hoglins are scared of warped fungi and nether portals <br>
                            - Piglins require a spore-filled atmosphere to avoid becoming zombified <br>

                            - Yellow allays are no longer present in the overworld <br>
                            <br>

                            I have many pet peeves, things that really grind my gears for both petty and moral reasons. <br>

                            - Asking if something extremely specific is planned for a project instead of just suggesting a feature <br>
                            - Tone indicators, especially /hj which is the stupidest thing to ever be invented <br>
                            - 'Straight invalidation' <br>
