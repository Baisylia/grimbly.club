                            Minecraft updates can be quite the divisive topic, as everyone has their own thoughts on what the game should be and what <br>
                            should be changed to make it the best game it can be. Through my development of my modpack

                                        1.20.3, or 'Bats and Pots', is the first of many 'game drops', a trend started after 1.20. I think that game drops are stupid, the whole <br>
                                        point of version numbers is that they show which versions are major updates and which are minor changes. And now there <br>
                                        are just a bunch of updates with minor change version numbers that are actually major-ish updates? Are all of the game <br>
                                        drops released post 1.21 just part of Tricky Trials? They are all extensions of 1.21 so that's how it looks. <br>
                                        Despite my problems with game drops, that doesn't mean the changes in these smaller updates are necessarily bad. A lot of <br>
                                        them are quite good, and while this one in particular is fairly small, it made a couple of changes that I love. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Bats have always looked weird with their pixel inconsistent designs. I never thought I would see them get updated, yet <br>
                                        here we are. I adore their new design and I wish my existing merchandise involving bats could update with them. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Decorated pots being made to be able to store items felt like a no brainer to me. It's both fun and useful, adding utility <br>
                                        to an otherwise decoration-only block. I think that more blocks deserve updates like this. I'm not huge on the animations <br>
                                        for inserting items though, to me it feels somewhat strange for the block to move in such a smooth way. <br>

                                        1.20.5, or 'Armored Paws', is another game drop, implementing the mob from Minecraft's final mob vote, which I voted for. <br>
                                        Because of this, it should be obvious that I am quite happy with this update, though it certainly has its issues. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Armadillos are the mob I voted to join the game, as I have wanted wolf armour for a very, very long time. I think that the <br>
                                        mob is quite fun, if not a bit of a strange addition to the game when compared to the existing animals. Them crawling up into <br>
                                        a ball is quite cute, and being able to brush off their scutes is a cool addition that I would love to see added to turtles <br>
                                        as well. I'm not huge on how scute brushing works though, rather than there being a cooldown on each armadillo, you can just <br>
                                        spam click them until your brush breaks. That combined with armadillos randomly dropping scutes on ocassion makes me not very <br>
                                        fond of their scute mechanics overall. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wolf armour, as I previously mentioned, is something I have always wanted to be in the game, and so I love this addition. <br>
                                        Having it tied to armadillos is not exactly the way I would implement it myself, as it could have just worked the same way as <br>
                                        horse armour. Mob uses like this are very strange and I feel as though there are better ways to make mobs useful than tying them <br>
                                        arbitrarily to items such as this. I still enjoy having wolf armour though, and I can see myself actually taking wolves out into <br>
                                        the world with me thanks to their addition. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wolf variants are really cool, and are an example of an unexpected feature stemming from a vote. Some other examples of this <br>
                                        phenomenon include glow berries, fireflies, and practically all of 1.18. Dog types had been a long requested feature, so to see <br>
                                        them finally come to the game while also making wolves spawn in more locations was really cool. <br>

                                        1.21, or 'Tricky Trials', is the first (and last) major update since game drops were introduced, adding a variety of features <br>
                                        mostly relating to the new trial chambers. A lot of people seem to not care about this update that much, but I think it was <br>
                                        actually quite a decent update, adding some really cool features that I wouldn't want to live without now. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Trial chambers are really cool structures that I have had a lot of fun with. They can be quite difficult to fight through, <br>
                                        but also feel worth the effort unlike a lot of the structures in the game. My main problems are that it can be difficult to <br>
                                        find these structures at times, making this update feel very self contained, and that the chambers are full of copper blocks. <br>
                                        Copper is not a useful resource, but now that you can get stacks upon stacks of the stuff from a single structure there is no <br>
                                        hope of it ever becoming a useful resource. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Trial vaults and spawners replace regular chests and spawners in trial chambers, and they function in a very cool way. Allowing <br>
                                        multiple players to fight through the chambers by limiting rewards to keys and vaults is a good way of keeping chambers replayable, <br>
                                        and I hope to see these blocks used in more structures in the future. I also appreciate that the spawners create more difficult <br>
                                        waves when there are more players around, the blocks work together really well to make the chambers function to their fullest in <br>
                                        both singleplayer and multiplayer. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Breezes are an awesome mob, I love the idea of element type blaze alternatives so much. I hope that we see more mobs of this nature <br>
                                        in the future. For a blaze alternative the breeze is also very unique, it almost acts more like a boss mob than the blaze does with <br>
                                        its wind attacks and evading strategies. Wind charges are a very cool alternative to fire charges, and make me wish that fire charges <br>
                                        could be thrown like fireballs in a similar way to the wind charges. It's a bit weird that wind charges come directly from breeze rods, <br>
                                        when fire charges come from blaze powder not blaze rods, but if they had no other ideas for breeze powder uses then I suppose it's <br>
                                        better to have less item bloat. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The mace is a pretty fun weapon, that I've enjoyed messing around with in my testing. Unfortunately it feels way to rare to me to <br>
                                        actually be worth anything. It's a similar case to the trident, but turned up to 11, and I can't justify their cost for their gimmick. <br>
                                        I also think that adding the heavy core just as an ingredient to craft the mace is stupid. You could just have maces come from vaults <br>
                                        like tridents do. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Ominous bottles solve a problem I've had with illager raids, that being the instant bad omen you get from eliminating a patrol. The <br>
                                        choice to activate bad omen yourself is quite the welcome one, though I don't know if I would have chosen a consumable liquid myself. <br>
                                        Tying bad omen in with trial chambers is a pretty fun idea, I always prefer adding new uses to existing mechanics rather than making <br>
                                        new mechanics that feel very similar. <br>

                                        - Crafters are something I never thought we would see in the game, and are also something I've always modded into it myself. While the <br>
                                        mechanics of the block seem a little bit janky to me, I think this is a great addition that opens up a world of possibilities in <br>
                                        automation. This one of the best features of this update. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Bogged are a swampy skeleton variant, which has been explored before in other forms through things like Minecraft Dungeons. I think <br>
                                        the bogged is the best version of this idea, and has much more of a personality than strays. I appreciate that they were even added at <br>
                                        all, since originally they were just regular skeletons with poison arrows in chambers. They went above and beyond to make this version <br>
                                        of the mob interesting, even making them shearable. Of all the undead variants this is one of my favourites. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The new copper block types are great, and honestly they should have just been added along with copper originally. As I previously <br>
                                        mentioned I do not like them generating in such a large quantity in chambers, but that's more of a structure issue than a problem with <br>
                                        these blocks. They look nice and I enjoy using them, and I am so happy that they changed the terrible trapdoor and door recipes that <br>
                                        they came with originally. A lot of people were dissapointed by the changes to the copper bulb, but I don't really care personally. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I find the new potions to be kind of strange. Not bad necessarily, but just a bit weird in comparison to the existing potions. The <br>
                                        infestation potion is the least strange to me, and I think it's pretty cool despite the recipe just requiring stone. The other three <br>
                                        potions causing something to happen when you die is what I find the most strange, and while I understand their purpose in context of <br>
                                        trial chambers, they feel a bit odd to exist as potions outside of that. I prefer oozing to weaving and wind charging for similar <br>
                                        reasons to infestation, weaving is fine, and wind charging is definitely my least favourite. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The new discs in this update are pretty great for the most part, I quite like a lot of the new music in this update in general. I <br>
                                        can't decide if I like Precipice of Creator more, but I do know that Creator (Music Box) is one of the worst discs in the game. I can <br>
                                        appreciate it as a version of Creator that just sticks to the music box aesthetic, but I wish it had just stayed a remix online or <br>
                                        something. It's just dissapointing to get the music box version, and for some reason that's usually the one I get. <br>

                                        1.21.2, or 'Bundles of Bravery', is another game drop, adding just one feature if you don't count bedrock edition finally <br>
                                        getting hardcore mode. (Which I don't.) <br>

                                        - Bundles should have been added to the game a long time ago. Being a relic of 1.17, they had a long time to cook, and it <br>
                                        is baffling to me that it took so long to add them. The reason I believe it took so long for bundles to be properly added, <br>
                                        is the problem Minecraft faces due to its many platform versions. While the bundles worked perfectly well on java edition <br>
                                        in snapshots from back when they were originally created, they had to figure out how to get them to work on consoles and <br>
                                        mobile devices. This is also why I believe bundles changed so much when they were finally implemented. And these changes are <br>
                                        just really not great. The way they worked before was simple and easy, allowing you to see all the items inside and insert / <br>
                                        deposit items into it simply. All they had to do was add an option to scroll through which item you are currently selecting <br>
                                        in the bundle to drop, and it would have been perfect. But alas, they changed it to a new system that works better on mobile <br>
                                        phones because that is their priority. It's a real shame, but at least we have bundles now. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Ignoring their history, the addition of bundles is really good. A lot of people dismiss them as though them only having one <br>
                                        slot doesn't 'solve' the inventory issue. But this one slot is so very useful! It is so easy to make space in your inventory <br>
                                        when you can combine items of different types into one slot. Bundles are a must have for me in any playthrough. <br>

                                        1.21.4, or 'The Garden Awakens', is another game drop, and it is a fairly underrated one in my opinion. There isn't much in this <br>
                                        update that I actively dislike, it is all fairly decent stuff. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Creaking hearts are the sculk shriekers of pale gardens, spawning the creaking based on certain factors. I enjoy that <br>
                                        while there are many similarities between these blocks, they do have fairly different mechanics. Whereas sculk shriekers <br>
                                        spawn wardens to protect the deep dark, the creaking heart acts more like the true body of the creaking, using the mob <br>
                                        creaking as a vessel to attack the player at night. I also appreciate that it allows resin to be a renewable resource. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Eyeblossoms are a very cool looking flower, and I appreciate their mechanic of opening and closing depending on the day, <br>
                                        it is a mechanic that ties in well with the creaking heart. I do not however like that there are two items for the flower <br>
                                        depending on its state, this could have very well just been a blockstate and I don't understand why open eyeblossoms make <br>
                                        a different dye to closed eyeblossoms. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I love moss, so pale moss is a very welcomed addition for me. Pale moss carpets are also nice, and I like that it grows <br>
                                        up walls, it would be cool to see regular moss carpets do this too. I find it weird that certain blocks have mossy variants <br>
                                        when it could just be an overlay block or a system similar to waterlogging. Pale hanging moss is the star of the show when it <br>
                                        comes to pale moss, and I really like how it blends the ground and the treetops together in the pale gardens. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Pale gardens are a pretty cool concept, a cool antithesis to the dark oak forests. I think that the biome is quite good, <br>
                                        though due to it being based on the dark oak forest it suffers its same issues, notably that the tree shapes suck. The pale <br>
                                        garden would be much better if the tree shapes were taller and less flat in the foliage region. Like many others, I think <br>
                                        that the biome could use a dense fog to make it feel creepier. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Pale oak is a really good wood type, it's kind of wild that the game went so long without a white wood. It's very verstaile <br>
                                        for building, the log looks nice, and the doors/trapdoors have a cool texture. The stripped log texture is very smooth and <br>
                                        looks very nice in a wall. The sapling is also quite nice, especailly in comparison to the dark oak sapling.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Resin is a material I've wanted in the game for quite a while, and are a feature that many mods have attempted to make. <br>
                                        Tying it to the creaking heart is very different to the sap-collecting of mods, and isn't something I would have expected <br>
                                        from vanilla. The resin brick item feels somewhat unnecessary when there is already a resin clump item, but it is cool that <br>
                                        it can be used as an armour trim colour. The blockset is quite nice, although I personally don't build with orange very often. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I quite like the creaking, Mojang have wanted to create an asymmetrical mob for quite some time so I'm happy for them that <br>
                                        they finally have. I've wanted a weeping angel-type mob in the game for a long time, so I really enjoy the creaking's mechanics. <br>
                                        I like that it is tied to the creaking heart, and the particles leading you to the heart is a cool way to balance out you being <br>
                                        unable to attack the creaking itself. It's interesting how multiple of the recent hostile mobs now are not meant to be killed. <br>

                                        community has wanted for a long time. Despite this I think that there are also some parts to this game drop that <br>

                                        - Bushes are a fun addition that add some foliage variation to several biomes. I think the texture leaves a little <br>
                                        to be desired, but I'm glad they were added overall. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Cactus flowers are something I added to MC AT near the beginning of development, so it was cool to see them added <br>
                                        to the game officially. I think there's a missed potential with cactus fruit, especially with the concept from the <br>
                                        proposed badlands update. Besides that, it is a fun addition that I enjoy. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Fireflies were finally added to the game after people screaming about them for years. And yet I haven't seen all <br>
                                        that much about people using them... it's almost like people only wanted them because they couldn't have them. Strange. <br>
                                        I am a firm believer that all Minecraft bugs should be large like spiders, bees, and silverfish, so I despise fireflies <br>
                                        being particle sized. But if you renamed them to glowing spore bush or something with a resource pack, the firefly bush <br>
                                        is a fairly cool block and I enjoy its mechanics. It just would have been nice to have full sized fireflies like in the <br>
                                        mod Naturalist, which I have used in MC AT. <br>

                                        - Leaf litter is a really cool decoration block that both adds a new use to leaves and covers the realm of 'leaf carpets' <br>
                                        often add by mods. Leaf litter being brown is a great thing and anyone who thinks they should be green needs to go <br>
                                        outside and see what fallen leaves actually look like. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Short and tall dry grass are also great decoration blocks that add some life to the mostly boring desert. Unlike the <br>
                                        bush I think their textures are pretty solid. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wildflowers are the pink petals of birch forests, and I appreciate more biomes having ground covering flowers. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Test and test instance blocks seem pretty useful for development, which is greatly appreciated as a mod developer. <br>
                                        I'm not sure how often I'll get to use them, since I mostly focus on MC AT which is on 1.19.2, but I'm sure they will <br>
                                        be great for other developers. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Blue and brown eggs feel somewhat redundant to me, as you could just have eggs spawn the chicken assoicated with the <br>
                                        biome they are thrown in so it feels like item bloat. I also don't like that they aren't data driven, so if you want to <br>
                                        make a custom chicken type you can't make a custom egg type to go with it. That's pretty lame. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I really like the new animal variants for pigs, cows, and chickens, I never thought I would see the day where they got <br>
                                        added. I've wanted animal variants since Minecraft Earth was released, and while it's strange they didn't bring back any <br>
                                        of those designs, I am pleased with the ones that we got. It would have been nice if sheep got variants too, but at least <br>
                                        the change of having blue and yellow sheep spawning naturally was reverted. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wolf personalities are a random but fun addition that I was surprised to see, I would love other mobs to recieve this <br>
                                        same treatment so that there are more small differences between different animals. It would be interesting to see the <br>
                                        personalities affect other factors about mobs than just sounds, perhaps that will happen in the future. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I do not like the new spawn eggs. I think it's great to remove the speckled designs as there is quite a steep learning <br>
                                        curve for knowing which one is which, and they aren't very colourblind-friendly, but i just do not like the way they went <br>
                                        about the new designs. Each egg being a different size upsets me on a primal level, and I do not understand why mobs that <br>
                                        are affected by impaling have a ring of water around them. That is a very strange factor to point out in spawn eggs and I <br>
                                        don't like how they look. I also don't like how the eggs don't have eyes, but do have other facial features (except for <br>
                                        creepers and creepers only???). These new eggs are basically round funko pops and I'm not a fan. I much prefer the resource <br>
                                        pack
                                        <a href=" https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/mob-crates/" target="_blank">

                                        , it is far more creative and actually looks good. I will be using this in all of my instances, but I will be forced <br>
                                        to use the egg versions when I'm using mods for 1.21.5+ because their mobs will not magically adhere to this resource pack. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The lodestone being crafted with iron instead of netherite is a great change, as tying lodestones to late game never made <br>
                                        too much sense in the progression. It's a shame that it's yet another use for iron when copper is so limited, but copper's <br>
                                        balancing is too all over the place for it to be used in any recipes with the trial chambers being full of it. <br>

                                        - Camels spawning in deserts should have been the way they spawned from the start. Camels are not just tamed animals, they <br>
                                        are also found in the wild. I'm glad that has changed. <br>

                                        1.21.6, or 'Chase the Skies', is another game drop, adding a few cool ghast related features. It's a bit smaller than the <br>
                                        previous game drop, but they have all been fairly inconsistent in scale. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Happy ghasts are really cool mobs that I never expected to be added to the game. I've wanted baby ghasts to be in the game <br>
                                        since they were added to Minecraft Dungeons, and making them grow up to be happy by letting them live in the overworld is some <br>
                                        really cool lore that ties into that one advancement about freeing a ghast from the nether. Being able to ride happy ghasts is <br>
                                        extremely cool, and being able to take others with you on them is really fun. Their harnesses look a little goofy, but in a way <br>
                                        that I appreciate. I also love that their addition came with a ghast retexture, finally making them more pixel consistent. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The new lead mechanics are really cool, and I enjoy how they interact with happy ghasts especially. It seems to have been inspired <br>
                                        by the Minecraft Movie, and that is something I'm all here for. Chaining mobs together allows for many different use cases, even <br>
                                        if it invalidates llama caravans somewhat (but that mechanic has always sucked anyway). <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Saddles being craftable is something I thought would just never happen, saddles being such an old feature that have remained as <br>
                                        dungeon loot for so long. Them becoming craftable is great, and gives me hope that some day horse armour and name tags will get <br>
                                        this same treatment. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The player locator bar seems kind of cool, though I can't imagine using it myself very often. I don't have too many thoughts on <br>
                                        it other than it's weird to outright replace the experience bar while using it. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I'm personally not huge on the Tears music disc. It isn't awful, but it isn't amazing either. It may grow on me over time but for <br>
                                        now it isn't something I'd go out of my way to listen to. I do find it strange however that you get the disc from killing a ghast <br>
                                        with its own fireball, one of the most common ways to kill a ghast. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - 1.21.7 being a patch for 1.21.6 really shows how stupid game drops are. From seeing the version numbers alone, you would have no <br>
                                        idea that one of them is a game drop and the other is a patch. It's completely ridiculous and stupid. The painting and disc that <br>
                                        this patch adds are also ridiculous and stupid. I personally do not like paintings that aren't made by Kristoffer Zetterstrand, I <br>
                                        think that the shrunk images of his works feel far more Minecrafty than normal pixel art paintings. I share a similar sentiment for <br>
                                        Minecraft's music. Minecraft songs should not ever be chiptune, or use noteblocks, mob sounds, or other game sounds (besides the <br>
                                        creepy lore discs like 11). The lava chicken disc defies these rules, being a song that does not fit in the game at all. It's like <br>
                                        they took a random remix off of YouTube and put it into the game. I do not like the precedent that this disc sets. I don't even <br>
                                        mind a Minecraft Movie reference being added to the game, but like this?? Really?? The villager sounds sound like AI. 1.21.7 may be <br>
                                        my least favourite update ever, and so with how game drops work, 1.21.6 is very negatively affected in my eyes thanks to it. <br>

                            According to Jeb's Minecraft design book, Minecraft is a multiverse. Every world has its own lore that is decided by the player. <br>
                            This is great, Minecraft is a game driven by the player's imagination after all, but it is clear that Mojang has its own lore in <br>
                            mind as well, that's how the creative process works. I like to think of their intended lore as the prime timeline, the true Minecraft <br>
                            world in the Minecraft multiverse. This prime world consists of all the lore set in the base game, as well as Minecraft Dungeons (MCD) <br>
                            and even Minecraft Legends (MCL).<br>
                            <br>
                            There is a case to be made that MCL is just a story told by villagers, but just like how MCD was the reason illagers were added to <br>
                            the base game, Mojang had MCL in mind when adding piglins to the base game. Whether or not all of MCL is completely factual, it is <br>
                            clear that it is at least based on their intentions for the prime timeline. This idea is assisted by the fact that the trailer for A <br>
                            Minecraft Movie (MCM) has an important Minecraft Legends character in it, the ideas established in MCL are persistent in other MC media. <br>
                            It could then also be argued that MCM is also canon to the prime timeline, but it is impossible to say for certain until it is released.<br>
                            <br>
                            The lore of the prime timeline is actually more set in stone than you may think at first, as the spinoff games are full of confirmed <br>
                            pieces of lore information, and Minecraft itself is full of small lore details. The following is lore that is inarguably confirmed, <br>
                            strongly assumed, and educatedly theorised. <br>
                            <br>
