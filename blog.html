                            Minecraft updates can be quite the divisive topic, as everyone has their own thoughts on what the game should be and what <br>
                            should be changed to make it the best game it can be. Through my development of my modpack

                            I have looked at each individual update with great scrutiny, and as such I have many thoughts about them all. The following <br>

                                        1.21.5 is one of the many 'game drops' made post Tricky Trials update. I think that game drops are stupid, the whole <br>
                                        point of version numbers is that they are major changes, and now all of these updates are just part of Tricky Trials? <br>
                                        Despite this, that doesn't mean the changes in the updates are necessarily bad. For the most part this game drop is <br>
                                        really good, and adds a lot of small features that the community has wanted, but there are also some parts that I <br>
                                        think are quite terrible. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Bushes are a fun addition that add some foliage variation to several biomes. I think the texture leaves a little <br>
                                        to be desired, but I'm glad they were added overall. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Cactus flowers are something I added to MC AT near the beginning of development, so it was cool to see them added <br>
                                        to the game officially. I think there's a missed potential with cactus fruit, especially with the concept from the <br>
                                        proposed badlands update. Besides that, it is a fun addition that I enjoy. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Fireflies were finally added to the game after people screaming about them for years. And yet I haven't seen all <br>
                                        that much about people using them... it's almost like people only wanted them because they couldn't have them. Strange. <br>
                                        I am a firm believer that all Minecraft bugs should be large like spiders, bees, and silverfish, so I despise fireflies <br>
                                        being particle sized. But if you renamed them to glowing spore bush or something with a resource pack, the firefly bush <br>
                                        is a fairly cool block and I enjoy its mechanics. It just would have been nice to have full sized fireflies like in the <br>
                                        mod Naturalist, which I have used in MC AT. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Leaf litter is a really cool decoration block that both adds a new use to leaves and covers the realm of 'leaf carpets' <br>
                                        often add by mods. Leaf litter being brown is a great thing and anyone who thinks they should be green needs to go <br>
                                        outside and see what fallen leaves actually look like. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Short and tall dry grass are also great decoration blocks that add some life to the mostly boring desert. Unlike the <br>
                                        bush I think their textures are pretty solid. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wildflowers are the pink petals of birch forests, and I appreciate more biomes having ground covering flowers. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Test and test instance blocks seem pretty useful for development, which is greatly appreciated as a mod developer. <br>
                                        I'm not sure how often I'll get to use them, since I mostly focus on MC AT which is on 1.19.2, but I'm sure they will <br>
                                        be great for other developers. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Blue and brown eggs feel somewhat redundant to me, as you could just have eggs spawn the chicken assoicated with the <br>
                                        biome they are thrown in so it feels like item bloat. I also don't like that they aren't data driven, so if you want to <br>
                                        make a custom chicken type you can't make a custom egg type to go with it. That's pretty lame. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I really like the new animal variants for pigs, cows, and chickens, I never thought I would see the day where they got <br>
                                        added. I've wanted animal variants since Minecraft Earth was released, and while it's strange they didn't bring back any <br>
                                        of those designs, I am pleased with the ones that we got. It would have been nice if sheep got variants too, but at least <br>
                                        the change of having blue and yellow sheep spawning naturally was reverted. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Wolf personalities are a random but fun addition that I was surprised to see, I would love other mobs to recieve this <br>
                                        same treatment so that there are more small differences between different animals. It would be interesting to see the <br>
                                        personalities affect other factors about mobs than just sounds, perhaps that will happen in the future. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I do not like the new spawn eggs. I think it's great to remove the speckled designs as there is quite a steep learning <br>
                                        curve for knowing which one is which, and they aren't very colourblind-friendly, but i just do not like the way they went <br>
                                        about the new designs. Each egg being a different size upsets me on a primal level, and I do not understand why mobs that <br>
                                        are affected by impaling have a ring of water around them. That is a very strange factor to point out in spawn eggs and I <br>
                                        don't like how they look. I also don't like how the eggs don't have eyes, but do have other facial features (except for <br>
                                        creepers and creepers only???). These new eggs are basically round funko pops and I'm not a fan. I much prefer the resource <br>
                                        pack
                                        <a href=" https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/mob-crates/" target="_blank">
                                            Mob Crates

                                        , it is far more creative and actually looks good. I will be using this in all of my instances, but I will be forced <br>
                                        to use the egg versions when I'm using mods for 1.21.5+ because their mobs will not magically adhere to this resource pack. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - The lodestone being crafted with iron instead of netherite is a great change, as tying lodestones to late game never made <br>
                                        too much sense in the progression. It's a shame that it's yet another use for iron when copper is so limited, but copper's <br>
                                        balancing is too all over the place for it to be used in any recipes with the trial chambers being full of it. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Camels spawning in deserts should have been the way they spawned from the start. Camels are not just tamed animals, they <br>
                                        are also found in the wild. I'm glad that has changed. <br>

                                        1.21.4 is another game drop, and it is a fairly underrated one in my opinion. There isn't much in this update that I <br>
                                        actively dislike, it is all fairly decent stuff. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Creaking hearts are the sculk shriekers of pale gardens, spawning the creaking based on certain factors. I enjoy that <br>
                                        while there are many similarities between these blocks, they do have fairly different mechanics. Whereas sculk shriekers <br>
                                        spawn wardens to protect the deep dark, the creaking heart acts more like the true body of the creaking, using the mob <br>
                                        creaking as a vessel to attack the player at night. I also appreciate that it allows resin to be a renewable resource. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Eyeblossoms are a very cool looking flower, and I appreciate their mechanic of opening and closing depending on the day, <br>
                                        it is a mechanic that ties in well with the creaking heart. I do not however like that there are two items for the flower <br>
                                        depending on its state, this could have very well just been a blockstate and I don't understand why open eyeblossoms make <br>
                                        a different dye to closed eyeblossoms. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I love moss, so pale moss is a very welcomed addition for me. Pale moss carpets are also nice, and I like that it grows <br>
                                        up walls, it would be cool to see regular moss carpets do this too. I find it weird that certain blocks have mossy variants <br>
                                        when it could just be an overlay block or a system similar to waterlogging. Pale hanging moss is the star of the show when it <br>
                                        comes to pale moss, and I really like how it blends the ground and the treetops together in the pale gardens. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Pale gardens are a pretty cool concept, a cool antithesis to the dark oak forests. I think that the biome is quite good, <br>
                                        though due to it being based on the dark oak forest it suffers its same issues, notably that the tree shapes suck. The pale <br>
                                        garden would be much better if the tree shapes were taller and less flat in the foliage region. Like many others, I think <br>
                                        that the biome could use a dense fog to make it feel creepier. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Pale oak is a really good wood type, it's kind of wild that the game went so long without a white wood. It's very verstaile <br>
                                        for building, the log looks nice, and the doors/trapdoors have a cool texture. The stripped log texture is very smooth and <br>
                                        looks very nice in a wall. The sapling is also quite nice, especailly in comparison to the dark oak sapling.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        - Resin is a material I've wanted in the game for quite a while, and are a feature that many mods have attempted to make. <br>
                                        Tying it to the creaking heart is very different to the sap-collecting of mods, and isn't something I would have expected <br>
                                        from vanilla. The resin brick item feels somewhat unnecessary when there is already a resin clump item, but it is cool that <br>
                                        it can be used as an armour trim colour. The blockset is quite nice, although I personally don't build with orange very often. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        - I quite like the creaking, Mojang have wanted to create an asymmetrical mob for quite some time so I'm happy for them that <br>
                                        they finally have. I've wanted a weeping angel-type mob in the game for a long time, so I really enjoy the creaking's mechanics. <br>
                                        I like that it is tied to the creaking heart, and the particles leading you to the heart is a cool way to balance out you being <br>
                                        unable to attack the creaking itself. It's interesting how multiple of the recent hostile mobs now are not meant to be killed. <br>

                            In the last couple of years I've been exploring the person that I am and who want to be, how I feel and I'm percieved. <br>
                            Creativity strikes from the influences around you, an as someone who is often online I am often inspired by online creators. <br>

                        <p class="align-left paragraph">
                            According to Jeb's Minecraft design book, Minecraft is a multiverse. Every world has its own lore that is decided by the player. <br>
                            This is great, Minecraft is a game driven by the player's imagination after all, but it is clear that Mojang has its own lore in <br>
                            mind as well, that's how the creative process works. I like to think of their intended lore as the prime timeline, the true Minecraft <br>
                            world in the Minecraft multiverse. This prime world consists of all the lore set in the base game, as well as Minecraft Dungeons (MCD) <br>
                            and even Minecraft Legends (MCL).<br>
                            <br>
                            There is a case to be made that MCL is just a story told by villagers, but just like how MCD was the reason illagers were added to <br>
                            the base game, Mojang had MCL in mind when adding piglins to the base game. Whether or not all of MCL is completely factual, it is <br>
                            clear that it is at least based on their intentions for the prime timeline. This idea is assisted by the fact that the trailer for A <br>
                            Minecraft Movie (MCM) has an important Minecraft Legends character in it, the ideas established in MCL are persistent in other MC media. <br>
                            It could then also be argued that MCM is also canon to the prime timeline, but it is impossible to say for certain until it is released.<br>
                            <br>
                            The lore of the prime timeline is actually more set in stone than you may think at first, as the spinoff games are full of confirmed <br>
                            pieces of lore information, and Minecraft itself is full of small lore details. The following is lore that is inarguably confirmed, <br>
                            strongly assumed, and educatedly theorised. <br>
                            <br>

                            - Hoglins are scared of warped fungi and nether portals <br>
                            - Piglins require a spore-filled atmosphere to avoid becoming zombified <br>

                            <br>

                            I have many pet peeves, things that really grind my gears for both petty and moral reasons. <br>
                            The following is an unorganised list of things that aggravate me. <br>
                            <br>
                            - When people act as though I should share my meal because it is a food that is usually shared, even though I'm eating it as my main meal <br>
                            - When people then say we can get another meal if I'm not full after sharing my meal <br>
                            - 'Culinary vegetables', tomatoes are fruits not vegetables, I don't care how they are used in cooking <br>
                            - The opinion of quantity over quality being better <br>
                            - Streaming services being the main way to access any media <br>
                            - People sucking crumbs off their fingers <br>
                            - When people ask when a mod will be updated to [x version] <br>
                            - People being early when I was prepared to be ready on time <br>
                            - People being late and I got ready for nothing <br>
                            - Asking if something extremely specific is planned for a project instead of just suggesting a feature <br>
                            - Tone indicators, especially /hj which is the stupidest thing to ever be invented <br>
