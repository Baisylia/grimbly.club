                    Grimbly Garden is a roguelite creature collection game I am developing where you explore dungeons to befriend and rescue grimblies to keep and raise in your garden. <br>
                    <br>
                    Grimbly Garden explores themes such as the magic circle, meta-awareness, agency, preservation, and pacifism. It also navigates LGBT+ topics and identity. The nature of <br>
                    the game’s world is slowly revealed over time as the player completes runs, and these themes are portrayed through how the world and its characters react to these changes. <br>
                    <br>
                    For reference of what the game is like, some of its inspirations include Slime Rancher 2, Sonic Adventure 2 Chao Gardens, Inscryption, DELTARUNE, and Cult of the Lamb. <br>
                    <br>
                    A prototype of the game is available
