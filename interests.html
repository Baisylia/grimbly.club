                                and traps on the way. You have 3 days to meet a scrap quota, which increases for the <br> 
                                next 3 days when met. You can use the money earnt from meeting quotas to buy tools, <br>
                                better planets, and cosmetics, but if the quota isn't met your team is fired. <br>

                                replayable. This combined with the proximity chat creates unique multiplayer <br>

                                I don't need to explain what Minecraft is, I have no doubt that you already know. <br>
                                It's the sandbox game that became the best selling game of all time, beating GTA 5 <br>
                                and becoming the only game to sell over 300,000,000 copies of itself. <br>
                                <br>
                                I started playing Minecraft in 2012 on my iPod touch, soon migrating to the official <br>
                                version on my iPad, and then to the Xbox 360. Eventually I got Java edition, which has <br>
                                since been my primary version of the game. I played the game when it was new and <br>
                                exciting, when it was considered cringey, when it had its resurgence, and to this day. <br>
                                <br>
                                Currently the trend of the Minecraft community is to hate on Mojang, for being lazy, <br>
                                or about the mob vote, or for any small change they make to features like redstone. <br>
                                I find it to be quite disappointing that so many feel the need to hate on developers <br>
                                that update their 15 year old game for free. Especially when these types of people <br>
                                don't understand either game design, Minecraft, or both. The game certainly has its <br>

                                it even has a multiplayer mode. I couldn't ask for anything more in a game.

                                Webfishing is a cute multiplayer fishing game where you relax, hang out, and catch <br>
                                fish. The game has a wonderful atmosphere that's great for just sitting around with <br>
                                your friends, and an art style that I can't get enough of. It's a fairly simple game, <br>
                                but it feels quite polished, and I particularly appreciate the available character <br>
                                customisation options and queer representation. <br>
                                <br>
                                This game is one of the only games I've played where I haven't felt the need to <br>
                                remake it myself, and that's quite the achievement. For what it is, Webfishing is <br>
                                pretty much perfect in my eyes.
