                <p class="align-left paragraph">
                    Verditen is an analogue horror card game set in space in the future, which has been in my game ideas backlog for a while. <br>
                    It is a 3D first-person game with a pixelated rendering art style, where you verse robots in card games on various planets and spacecraft which you can travel to. <br>
                    As you do so, there is a story to uncover about the world you've found yourself in, why all these robots are playing card games, and the identity of who you're playing as. <br>
                    <br>
                    The game is currently in the ideation stage, with concept art being developed and the story / card gameplay being designed. <br>
                    The game's lore has just about been finalised, but I won't leak too much information about it here, you'll have to play the game when it's released!
