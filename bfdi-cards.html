                <p class="align-left paragraph">
                    BFDI Cards (Name TBD) is a playing card game that I'm designing based on BFDI with two game modes. <br>
                    In the game you can both create your own fantasy BFDI seasons, or make them competitive by versing opponents with your own team of contestants. <br>
                    The fantasy season mode is akin to games like the Hunger Games Simulator, essentially acting as a season generator. <br>
                    The competitive mode is the opposite of a shedding card game like Uno, where you aim to be the last player with cards in their hand. <br>
                    I've been designing the cards in Illustrator to be used in Tabletop Simulator, and may eventually print them like I did with Last Card, my previous card game. <br>
                    <br>
                    The game features contestant cards for every official contestant, algebralien, mini contestant, speaker box, and notable recommended character. <br>
                    It also has challenge cards for every BFDI challenge, and item cards to add and remove stats from contestants of your choice. <br>
